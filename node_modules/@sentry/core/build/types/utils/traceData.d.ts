 * Extracts trace propagation data from the current span or from the client's scope (via transaction or propagation

 *
 * This function also applies some validation to the generated sentry-trace and baggage values to ensure that
 * only valid strings are returned.
 *
 * @param span a span to take the trace data from. By default, the currently active span is used.
 * @param scope the scope to take trace data from By default, the active current scope is used.
 * @param client the SDK's client to take trace data from. By default, the current client is used.
 *
 * @returns an object with the tracing data values. The object keys are the name of the tracing key to be used as header
 * or meta tag name.
